# Plan for Web Page Implementation

## Overview

The web page consists of the following major sections:

1. **Header**:
   - Contains the logo "jive" centered at the top.
   - Login and Sign-up buttons are positioned on the right side of the header.

2. **Main Hero Section**:
   - A prominent heading "Don't make connecting awkward" is centered.
   - Subheading text provides additional information about the service.
   - A "Sign up free" button is centered below the subheading.
   - Background includes colorful abstract shapes.

3. **Image Section**:
   - Two overlapping smartphone images are centered below the hero section.
   - The left phone displays a QR code, and the right phone shows a messaging interface.

4. **How It Works Section**:
   - Contains a heading "Here's how it works" centered.
   - Three steps are displayed horizontally, each with an icon, title, and description:
     1. Scan the QR code
     2. Send a message
     3. Follow-up from your inbox
   - A "Start jiving" button is centered below the steps.

5. **Footer**:
   - Contains the "jive" logo centered.
   - Links for About, Privacy, Terms, and Contact are displayed below the logo.
   - Copyright information is centered at the bottom.

### Layout Considerations

- **Flexbox vs. Grid**: 
  - **Flexbox** is recommended for the header, hero section, and footer due to its simplicity in aligning items horizontally and vertically.
  - **CSS Grid** can be used for the "How It Works" section to easily create a three-column layout.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Ensure the layout is responsive, adjusting the positions and sizes of elements for different screen sizes.
  - Media queries will be necessary to handle the layout changes, especially for the image section and the "How It Works" section.
